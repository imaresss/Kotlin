interface Consumer{

  fun getById(id : Int): Customer // no default implementation and needs to be overridden in class implementing it
  
  fun getStore(id : Int) : String{ // thire is defualt implementation
  // u can write code here
  }

}


class Employee : Consumer{

  override fun getById(id : Int) : Customer{
  }
  
  override fun getStore(id : Int) : String{
  
  super.getStore(id);
  // u can override this method also 
  }
  

}


// this looks similar to abstract class , the difference between them is tht interfaces do not maintain state (i.e. u can define a property but cannot assign a 
//value to it , another difference is that , you cannot have a class which inherits multipl normal or abstract classes , but what you can have is a class which
// inherits a class and that class inherits multipl interfaces
