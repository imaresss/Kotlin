Classes in Kotlin

Definition 
1) class Customer

Constructor 

class Customer(var id : Int , var name : String)

fun main(args : Array<String>){

  val customer = Customer(1 , "Pulkit");
}

This defines the constructor and it is necessary to use var/val (for id and name in this case) for to make a property of class
