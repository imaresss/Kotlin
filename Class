Classes in Kotlin

1) Definition 
 class Customer

2) Constructor 

class Customer(var id : Int , var name : String)

fun main(args : Array<String>){

  val customer = Customer(1 , "Pulkit");
}

This defines the constructor and it is necessary to use var/val (for id and name in this case) for to make a property of class 

3) init in constructor

class Customer(var id : Int , var name : String){

  init{
   name = name.toUpperCase();
  }

}

fun main(args : Array<String>){

  val customer = Customer(1 , "Pulkit");
}

The initializer block is executed when object is created

4) class Person -> this is a class declaration

   class Person() -> this is a class declaration with its constructor also
