1) fun main(args : Array<String>){

     launch{
        delay(1000)
     
     }
}

2) fun main(args : Array<String>){
      Thread.sleep(1000)

}
Consider these 2 examples , both would pause for 1sec , the difference is , in launch example  , the thread would give up the execution for 1sec and
would start to work on some ther task till 1sec is over and then would resume this execution , so it is non blocking , the thread would not just block roght there 
and do nothing , it will instead do some other task , whereas in the 2nd example , the trhead would get blocked for 1sec, doing nothing and would resume the 
execution after 1 sec
